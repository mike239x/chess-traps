searching for traps in the chess openings

The basic idea is this - find commmon positions where in the top few played moves (5-10) 
there is a move that despite being common leads to much lower winrate for the active player
(compared to other common moves). This most likely indicates that the opponent has some tactic which is not easy to see beforehand.
